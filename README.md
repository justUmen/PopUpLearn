# PopUpLearn (Work in progress)

Learning with popups.  
Made for GameScript but can be used to learn pretty much whatever you want.  

Content should be compatible with "WallpaperGenerator", "Brainz" and "GameScript quizzes".  

Everything is text-based in .pul files.  

Content is moved from the folder "ToLearn" to the folder "Learned" ???

Use ~/.PopUpLearn to store scripts and data.
